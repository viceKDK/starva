# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Eliminate manual price monitoring and receive instant WhatsApp alerts when price conditions are met
- Achieve peace of mind by automating market surveillance during work hours
- Improve trading/investment timing through immediate notifications
- Maintain productivity focus by reducing market-checking interruptions
- Deploy a reliable personal tool that works locally without external dependencies

## Background Context

Based on the project brief, this application addresses the productivity and stress issues caused by constant manual price monitoring of financial assets. Current solutions require checking multiple apps/websites repeatedly, creating interruptions and potential missed opportunities. 

This personal-use application provides a simple local server solution that automatically monitors configured price thresholds and delivers immediate WhatsApp notifications, allowing you to focus on other work while staying informed about critical market movements.
