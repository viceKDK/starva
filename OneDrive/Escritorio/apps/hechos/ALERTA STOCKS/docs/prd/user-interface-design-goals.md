# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Simple, functional web interface optimized for quick alert management. Focus on efficiency over aesthetics - clean forms, clear data tables, and immediate feedback. The interface should feel like a personal tool rather than a consumer app.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Form-first approach:** Primary interactions through simple HTML forms for creating/editing alerts
- **Table-based management:** Alert management via sortable tables with inline actions
- **Immediate feedback:** Real-time status updates and clear success/error messages
- **Single-page workflow:** Minimal navigation - everything accessible from main dashboard

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Alert creation form + alert management table on single page
- **Configuration Screen:** Settings for API keys, cooldown duration, and monitoring intervals

## Accessibility: None
Given the personal-use nature and local deployment, formal accessibility compliance is not required.

## Branding
Minimal, functional design with clean typography. No specific branding requirements - focus on readability and usability over visual design.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web-based interface that works well on desktop browsers, with basic mobile responsiveness for occasional mobile access.
