# Epic 3: Configuration & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Add robust configuration management, comprehensive error handling, logging capabilities, and deployment preparation to ensure the application runs reliably for daily personal use with minimal maintenance overhead.

## Story 3.1: Configuration Management System

As a user,
I want to configure application settings through environment variables and a web interface,
so that I can customize behavior without modifying code.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. .env file template provided with all configurable options documented
2. Web interface for viewing and updating key settings (intervals, cooldowns, API endpoints)
3. Configuration validation ensures valid ranges and formats
4. Settings changes take effect without requiring application restart where possible
5. Default values work out-of-the-box for immediate functionality
6. Configuration backup and restore functionality for settings preservation

## Story 3.2: Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

As a user,
I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide useful diagnostic information,
so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain reliable operation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Structured logging implemented with configurable log levels
2. API failures are logged with specific error details and retry information
3. Database errors are handled gracefully without data corruption
4. WhatsApp delivery failures are logged and displayed in web interface
5. Application startup validates all required configuration and external dependencies
6. Log rotation prevents log files from consuming excessive disk space

## Story 3.3: Health Monitoring and Status Dashboard

As a user,
I want to see the current health and status of all system components,
so that I can verify everything is working correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System status page shows connectivity to all external APIs
2. Last successful price fetch times displayed for each monitored asset
3. WhatsApp connectivity status and last message delivery confirmation
4. Database health check and basic performance metrics
5. Scheduler status with next execution times and recent activity log
6. Alert statistics showing trigger counts and cooldown status

## Story 3.4: Data Management and Backup

As a user,
I want to backup my database and manage alert data,
so that I can recover from system issues and maintain data integrity.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database backup occurs automatically with configurable frequency
2. Manual database backup function accessible through web interface
3. Database cleanup functionality removes old triggered alerts
4. Data validation ensures alert integrity and removes corrupted entries
5. Storage usage monitoring with cleanup recommendations
6. Database health checks verify data consistency

## Story 3.5: Production Deployment and Documentation

As a user,
I want clear instructions and tools for deploying the application,
so that I can set up and maintain the system reliably.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. README.md provides complete setup instructions from scratch
2. Requirements.txt includes all dependencies with version constraints
3. Startup scripts for Windows to run application as a service
4. Environment variable documentation with examples and security notes
5. Troubleshooting guide covers common issues and solutions
6. Migration path from Twilio Sandbox to WhatsApp Cloud API documented
