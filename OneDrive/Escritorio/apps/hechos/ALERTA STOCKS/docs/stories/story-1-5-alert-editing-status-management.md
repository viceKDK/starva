# Story 1.5: Alert Editing and Status Management

**Epic:** Foundation & Core Alert Management  
**Story ID:** 1.5  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 8

## Story

As a user,  
I want to activate, deactivate, and delete alerts,  
so that I can manage my monitoring configuration without recreating alerts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Toggle buttons successfully activate/deactivate alerts with visual feedback
2. ✅ Delete buttons remove alerts after user confirmation
3. ✅ Status changes persist across browser refreshes
4. ✅ Bulk operations work correctly when multiple alerts exist
5. ✅ UI provides clear visual distinction between active and inactive alerts
6. ✅ No accidental deletions possible without explicit confirmation

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Implement alert editing functionality
  - [x] Create edit modal with pre-populated form fields
  - [x] Add edit buttons to each alert row with proper styling
  - [x] Implement editAlert JavaScript function to load alert data
  - [x] Create modal form handling for alert updates
  - [x] Handle successful updates with form reset and table refresh

- [x] **Task 2:** Enhanced bulk operations for alerts  
  - [x] Add checkbox column to alerts table for selection
  - [x] Implement "select all" functionality with indeterminate state
  - [x] Create bulk action buttons (toggle/delete selected)
  - [x] Add confirmation dialogs for bulk operations
  - [x] Handle parallel API calls for bulk operations with progress feedback

- [x] **Task 3:** Enhanced visual status management
  - [x] Add left border indicators for active (green) and inactive (gray) alerts
  - [x] Apply strikethrough styling to inactive alert symbols
  - [x] Reduce opacity for inactive alert rows
  - [x] Enhanced status badges with proper color coding
  - [x] Professional modal styling for edit operations

- [x] **Task 4:** Advanced user interaction features
  - [x] Modal overlay system with proper focus management
  - [x] Keyboard navigation support (ESC to close modal)
  - [x] Form validation within edit modal
  - [x] Tooltips for action buttons
  - [x] Loading states during operations

- [x] **Task 5:** Comprehensive testing and validation
  - [x] Test complete alert editing workflow (create → edit → verify)
  - [x] Test partial field updates preserve other field values
  - [x] Test status persistence across operations
  - [x] Test bulk operations with multiple alerts
  - [x] Test error handling for invalid data and missing alerts

## Dev Notes

- Edit modal created dynamically with JavaScript for better performance
- Bulk operations use Promise.all for parallel API calls with proper error handling
- Visual indicators provide immediate feedback for alert status changes
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental bulk operations
- Form validation ensures data integrity during updates
- Modal system supports keyboard navigation and proper focus management

## Testing

- [x] Test alert editing workflow with all field types
- [x] Test partial updates maintain unchanged fields
- [x] Test status persistence across browser operations
- [x] Test bulk selection with select-all checkbox functionality
- [x] Test bulk toggle and delete operations with confirmations
- [x] Test visual distinction between active/inactive alerts
- [x] Test error scenarios (invalid data, missing alerts)
- [x] Test modal interactions (open, edit, close, submit)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive functionality
- [x] Alert editing modal system fully functional
- [x] Bulk operations working with proper confirmations
- [x] Enhanced visual status management with clear indicators
- [x] Status changes persist across all application operations
- [x] No accidental operations possible without explicit confirmation
- [x] Professional UI/UX with loading states and feedback
- [x] Complete test coverage for all editing scenarios
