# Story 3.3: Health Monitoring and Status Dashboard

**Epic:** Configuration & Production Readiness  
**Story ID:** 3.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 8

## Story

As a user,
I want to monitor the health and status of the application through a comprehensive dashboard,
so that I can quickly identify and troubleshoot issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Web-based health monitoring dashboard showing system status at a glance
2. Real-time monitoring of all application components (scheduler, APIs, database, WhatsApp)
3. Historical performance metrics and trend analysis
4. Alert delivery tracking with success/failure rates
5. System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
6. API endpoint health checks with response times
7. Configurable health check intervals and thresholds

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** Create health monitoring dashboard web interface
  - [ ] Design responsive dashboard layout with status cards
  - [ ] Implement real-time status updates via WebSocket or polling
  - [ ] Add interactive charts for performance metrics
  - [ ] Create alert history and delivery tracking views

- [ ] **Task 2:** Enhance health service with metrics collection
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection and storage
  - [ ] Implement historical data retention and cleanup
  - [ ] Add configurable health check thresholds
  - [ ] Create health trend analysis functionality

- [ ] **Task 3:** Add system monitoring capabilities
  - [ ] Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - [ ] Track application uptime and availability
  - [ ] Monitor external API response times and success rates
  - [ ] Add database performance monitoring

- [ ] **Task 4:** Create notification delivery tracking dashboard
  - [ ] Display WhatsApp message delivery statistics
  - [ ] Show notification failure reasons and retry attempts
  - [ ] Add delivery success rate trends over time
  - [ ] Create alert performance analysis

- [ ] **Task 5:** Implement automated health alerts
  - [ ] Configure health threshold alerts
  - [ ] Add email/webhook notifications for critical issues
  - [ ] Create health status API endpoints for monitoring systems
  - [ ] Add health check scheduling and automation

## Dev Notes

- Use responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
- Implement efficient data polling to avoid performance impact
- Consider using WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add export functionality for health reports
- Ensure dashboard is accessible without authentication for monitoring

## Testing

- [ ] Test dashboard responsiveness across devices
- [ ] Test real-time data updates and polling
- [ ] Test health check accuracy and performance
- [ ] Test notification delivery tracking
- [ ] Test system resource monitoring

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Health monitoring dashboard implemented
- [ ] Real-time system status monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and display
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation for health monitoring features
