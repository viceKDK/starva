# Story 3.4: Data Management and Backup

**Epic:** Configuration & Production Readiness  
**Story ID:** 3.4  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 8

## Story

As a user,
I want to manage application data with automated backup and recovery capabilities,
so that I can protect against data loss and maintain system integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Automated database backup system with configurable schedules
2. Database integrity checks and repair functionality  
3. Data cleanup and archival for old records
4. Database migration and schema update tools
5. Data retention policies for logs and historical data
6. System data validation and consistency checks

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** Implement automated database backup system
  - [ ] Create backup service with scheduling capabilities
  - [ ] Support multiple backup formats (SQLite copy, SQL dump)
  - [ ] Implement backup rotation and cleanup
  - [ ] Add backup verification and integrity checks

- [ ] **Task 2:** Create data management utilities
  - [ ] Database integrity checking and repair
  - [ ] Old data cleanup and archival
  - [ ] Orphaned record detection and cleanup
  - [ ] Data consistency validation

- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement data retention policies
  - [ ] Configurable retention periods for different data types
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup of expired logs and metrics
  - [ ] Archive old notification attempts and alerts
  - [ ] Maintain performance with data growth

- [ ] **Task 4:** Add database migration tools
  - [ ] Schema version tracking and migration system
  - [ ] Safe schema update procedures
  - [ ] Rollback capabilities for failed migrations
  - [ ] Data migration validation

- [ ] **Task 5:** Create data management web interface
  - [ ] Display database statistics and health
  - [ ] Manual backup triggers and restoration
  - [ ] Data cleanup controls and monitoring
  - [ ] Backup history and management

## Dev Notes

- Use SQLite's built-in backup capabilities where possible
- Implement backup encryption for sensitive data
- Ensure backups don't impact application performance
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Consider backup storage location configuration

## Testing

- [ ] Test automated backup scheduling and execution
- [ ] Test backup integrity and restoration
- [ ] Test data cleanup and archival processes
- [ ] Test database migration scenarios
- [ ] Test web interface functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Automated backup system implemented
- [ ] Data management utilities created
- [ ] Retention policies configured
- [ ] Database migration tools available
- [ ] Web interface for data management
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
