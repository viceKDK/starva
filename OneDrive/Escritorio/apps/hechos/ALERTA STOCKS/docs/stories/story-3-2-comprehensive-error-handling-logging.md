# Story 3.2: Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

**Epic:** Configuration & Production Readiness  
**Story ID:** 3.2  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 8

## Story

As a user,
I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide useful diagnostic information,
so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain reliable operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Structured logging implemented with configurable log levels
2. API failures are logged with specific error details and retry information
3. Database errors are handled gracefully without data corruption
4. WhatsApp delivery failures are logged and displayed in web interface
5. Application startup validates all required configuration and external dependencies
6. Log rotation prevents log files from consuming excessive disk space

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** Implement structured logging system
  - [ ] Configure logging with proper formatters and handlers
  - [ ] Add rotating file handlers with size limits
  - [ ] Implement contextual logging with request IDs
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics logging

- [ ] **Task 2:** Enhance API error handling and retry logic
  - [ ] Improve external API error handling with specific error types
  - [ ] Add comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Log API failures with detailed context and retry attempts
  - [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing APIs

- [ ] **Task 3:** Database error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Add database connection pooling and error recovery
  - [ ] Implement transaction rollback on errors
  - [ ] Add data integrity checks and validation
  - [ ] Log database operations with performance metrics

- [ ] **Task 4:** WhatsApp delivery tracking and error reporting
  - [ ] Track message delivery status and failures
  - [ ] Store delivery attempts in database for web interface
  - [ ] Add retry logic for failed WhatsApp messages
  - [ ] Display delivery status in web interface

- [ ] **Task 5:** Application health checks and startup validation
  - [ ] Validate all external dependencies on startup
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive health checks
  - [ ] Add graceful shutdown procedures
  - [ ] Create system diagnostics and troubleshooting tools

## Dev Notes

- Use structured logging (JSON format) for better parsing and monitoring
- Implement proper error hierarchies for different error types
- Add correlation IDs for tracing requests across components
- Consider log aggregation and monitoring solutions
- Implement proper error boundaries in the web interface

## Testing

- [ ] Test logging configuration and rotation
- [ ] Test API error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Test database error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Test WhatsApp delivery tracking
- [ ] Test health checks and startup validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Structured logging system implemented
- [ ] Enhanced error handling for all components
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated with troubleshooting guide
