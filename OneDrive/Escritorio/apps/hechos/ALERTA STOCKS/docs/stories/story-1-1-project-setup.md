# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure

**Epic:** Foundation & Core Alert Management  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 5

## Story

As a developer,  
I want to set up the basic Python project structure with FastAPI and SQLite,  
so that I have a solid foundation to build the alert management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Python project structure created with main.py, requirements.txt, and .env template
2. FastAPI application runs successfully on localhost:8000
3. SQLite database connection established with basic health check endpoint
4. Basic HTML template structure created with Jinja2 integration
5. Static file serving configured for CSS/JS assets
6. Environment variable loading implemented for configuration

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Create project directory structure with all required folders
  - [x] Create main project structure (src/, templates/, static/, tests/, data/, logs/)
  - [x] Create main.py entry point
  - [x] Create requirements.txt with FastAPI, SQLite, Jinja2 dependencies
  - [x] Create .env.example template with configuration variables

- [x] **Task 2:** Set up FastAPI application with basic routing
  - [x] Initialize FastAPI app with basic configuration
  - [x] Set up static file serving for CSS/JS
  - [x] Configure Jinja2 template engine
  - [x] Create health check endpoint (/health)

- [x] **Task 3:** Implement SQLite database connection
  - [x] Set up database connection utilities
  - [x] Create database initialization function
  - [x] Implement basic connection health check

- [x] **Task 4:** Create basic HTML template structure
  - [x] Create base.html template with common structure
  - [x] Create dashboard.html template for main interface
  - [x] Set up basic CSS structure for styling

- [x] **Task 5:** Environment configuration setup
  - [x] Implement settings module for environment variables
  - [x] Load configuration from .env file
  - [x] Set up logging configuration

## Dev Notes

- Follow the unified project structure from architecture docs
- Use Python 3.8+ with FastAPI 0.100+
- SQLite 3.35+ for local persistence
- Implement according to coding standards (environment config through settings module)
- Ensure localhost:8000 binding only for security

## Testing

- [ ] Test FastAPI application starts successfully
- [ ] Test health check endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Test static file serving works
- [ ] Test template rendering works
- [ ] Test database connection is established
- [ ] Test environment configuration loads correctly

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Application runs on localhost:8000
- [ ] Health check endpoint functional
- [ ] Basic template structure renders
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Environment configuration functional
