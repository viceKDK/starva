# Story 1.3: Alert Creation Web Interface

**Epic:** Foundation & Core Alert Management  
**Story ID:** 1.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 5

## Story

As a user,  
I want to create new price alerts through a web form,  
so that I can configure which assets to monitor.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Web form displays with fields for asset symbol, asset type dropdown, condition dropdown, and threshold price
2. ✅ Form validation prevents empty submissions and validates numeric threshold values
3. ✅ Successful alert creation redirects to alert list with success message
4. ✅ Form errors display clearly with specific validation messages
5. ✅ Asset type dropdown contains only "Stock" and "Crypto" options
6. ✅ Condition dropdown contains only ">=" and "<=" options

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Create web form HTML structure
  - [x] Design form layout with proper input fields
  - [x] Add asset symbol text input with validation
  - [x] Create asset type dropdown (Stock/Crypto only)
  - [x] Create condition dropdown (>=/<= only)
  - [x] Add threshold price number input with validation

- [x] **Task 2:** Implement FastAPI route for alert creation
  - [x] Create POST endpoint accepting form data
  - [x] Integrate with AlertService for data persistence
  - [x] Handle validation errors and return appropriate responses
  - [x] Include proper logging for alert creation events

- [x] **Task 3:** Add client-side form handling
  - [x] Implement JavaScript form submission handler
  - [x] Add form validation before submission
  - [x] Handle loading states and disable submit during processing
  - [x] Reset form after successful submission

- [x] **Task 4:** Create success/error messaging system
  - [x] Design message display components in CSS
  - [x] Implement JavaScript message display functions
  - [x] Add auto-hide for success messages
  - [x] Ensure error messages remain visible until dismissed

- [x] **Task 5:** Comprehensive testing
  - [x] Create API endpoint tests for all scenarios
  - [x] Test successful alert creation flow
  - [x] Test validation error handling
  - [x] Test edge cases and error conditions

## Dev Notes

- Form uses HTML5 validation combined with server-side Pydantic validation
- JavaScript handles async form submission with fetch API
- Messages appear as dismissible notifications in top-right corner
- All form data sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- Success responses return complete AlertResponse schema

## Testing

- [x] Test form displays correctly with all required fields
- [x] Test asset type validation (only 'stock' or 'crypto')
- [x] Test condition type validation (only '>=' or '<=')
- [x] Test threshold price validation (positive numbers only)
- [x] Test form submission and success messaging
- [x] Test error handling and error message display
- [x] Test API endpoint with various input combinations

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Web form functional with proper validation
- [x] FastAPI routes implemented and tested
- [x] Success/error messaging system working
- [x] Form integrates with database through AlertService
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code follows project coding standards
- [x] Proper error handling and logging
