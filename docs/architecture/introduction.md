# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Personal Running Tracker MVP, including mobile application systems, local data storage, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate mobile and data architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern local-first applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.
