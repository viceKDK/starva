# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- **Location Privacy:** GPS data never leaves device, stored locally only
- **Data Encryption:** SQLite database encrypted using iOS data protection
- **App Security:** Standard iOS app sandbox and code signing

**Local Data Security:**
- **Access Control:** iOS device lock screen and biometric authentication
- **Data Persistence:** Secure local storage using iOS file system protection
- **Privacy First:** No network transmissions of personal data

**Authentication Security:**
- **Device Security:** Relies on iOS device security model
- **No User Accounts:** Single-user app eliminates authentication attack vectors
- **Local Only:** No external authentication or session management required

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- **Bundle Size Target:** < 50MB total app size for App Store compliance
- **GPS Efficiency:** 1-second GPS sampling optimized for battery life
- **Database Performance:** Indexed SQLite queries for sub-100ms response times

**Local Data Performance:**
- **SQLite Optimization:** Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- **Memory Management:** Efficient GPS point collection and storage
- **Battery Optimization:** Location services configured for running activity
