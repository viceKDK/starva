# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Expo Application Services for crash reporting and basic analytics
- **Backend Monitoring:** N/A - Local-only application with no backend services
- **Error Tracking:** Console logging for development, Expo crash reporting for production
- **Performance Monitoring:** React Native Performance Monitor for development debugging

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- App launch time
- GPS accuracy and acquisition time
- SQLite query performance
- Memory usage during long runs
- Battery impact during GPS tracking
- User interaction patterns

**Local Data Metrics:**
- Database query execution time
- Storage space usage growth
- GPS point collection frequency
- Route calculation performance
- Personal record update frequency
