# External APIs

**No External APIs Required** - This application operates entirely offline with local device capabilities:

- **GPS Data:** Obtained directly from iOS Location Services via expo-location
- **Maps:** React Native Maps uses device's native mapping capabilities (MapKit on iOS)
- **No Internet Dependency:** All functionality works without network connectivity

The local-first architecture eliminates external API dependencies, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.
