# Personal Running Tracker MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable simple, privacy-first personal running tracking without social features or cloud dependencies
- Capture and store complete run data (GPS route, time, distance, pace) locally on iOS device
- Provide immediate access to run history and personal records for motivation and progress tracking
- Deliver stable, responsive app performance with zero data loss during GPS tracking
- Complete MVP development within 6 weeks using Expo framework for rapid iteration

### Background Context

The current running app landscape is dominated by social-first platforms like Strava and Nike Run Club that prioritize community engagement over simple personal tracking. These apps require user accounts, upload personal data to corporate servers, and include complex features that create friction for users who simply want to track their own runs privately.

With growing privacy awareness and the maturity of frameworks like Expo, there's now an opportunity to create a local-first running tracker that serves individual needs without compromising simplicity or data privacy. This app will focus exclusively on core tracking functionality, storing all data locally and eliminating the complexity that makes existing solutions unsuitable for private personal use.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The app embraces extreme simplicity with a focus on immediate utility. The design follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines with a clean, distraction-free interface that prioritizes functionality over visual complexity. The user experience centers around a "3-tap workflow": open app, start run, view results.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-tap run start**: Primary action prominently displayed on home screen
- **Gesture-based navigation**: Standard iOS swipe patterns for navigation
- **Real-time feedback**: Live updating metrics during runs without overwhelming information
- **Context-aware UI**: Interface adapts based on tracking state (idle, active, paused)

### Core Screens and Views
- **Home/Tracking Screen**: Main interface with run controls and real-time metrics
- **Run Completion Screen**: Post-run summary with route map and statistics
- **History Screen**: Chronological list of completed runs with basic metrics
- **Run Detail Screen**: Individual run details with full route map and comprehensive stats
- **Settings Screen**: Minimal configuration for units, permissions, and data management

### Accessibility: None
MVP focuses on basic functionality; accessibility features deferred to Phase 2.

### Branding
Minimal design aesthetic emphasizing clarity and function over brand elements. Clean typography, ample whitespace, and iOS-native design patterns. Color palette limited to iOS system colors with accent color for primary actions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only
iPhone only for MVP (iOS 13+). Optimized for all iPhone screen sizes from iPhone SE to iPhone Pro Max.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Single Repository
Standard Expo managed workflow project structure with clean component organization by feature and layer (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure).

### Service Architecture
Local-first architecture with no backend services. All business logic runs on device with SQLite for persistence and Expo Location for GPS tracking. No external service dependencies beyond iOS system services.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library for component and service testing
**Integration Testing**: End-to-end GPS tracking and database persistence validation
**Device Testing**: Real device testing required for GPS accuracy and battery performance validation
**Manual Testing**: User journey testing for all core workflows

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- React Navigation 6+ for screen navigation
- expo-sqlite for local database persistence
- expo-location for GPS tracking capabilities
- react-native-maps for route visualization
