# Project Brief: Personal Running Tracker MVP

## Executive Summary

**Personal Running Tracker** is a simple, local iOS app for individual running tracking and performance monitoring. The app captures GPS routes, tracks time/distance/pace, and stores personal running history without any social features, user accounts, or cloud dependencies. Built with Expo for rapid development, it focuses on core running metrics and route visualization, similar to Strava but stripped down to essential personal tracking features only.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Existing running apps like Strava, Nike Run Club, and Garmin Connect are over-engineered for simple personal use cases. They require user accounts, push social features, include unnecessary complexity (training plans, social feeds, premium subscriptions), and often have privacy concerns with data sharing.

**Pain Points:**
- **Privacy Concerns:** Personal running data uploaded to corporate servers
- **Feature Bloat:** Complex interfaces with features that distract from core tracking
- **Mandatory Accounts:** Required sign-ups for basic functionality
- **Social Pressure:** Unwanted social features and comparisons
- **Offline Limitations:** Dependency on internet connectivity for basic features

**Impact:** Runners who simply want personal tracking and route history are forced to use complex platforms designed for social engagement and advanced training, creating friction and privacy concerns for basic use cases.

**Why Now:** With growing privacy awareness and the maturity of mobile development frameworks like Expo, it's now feasible to create focused, local-first applications that serve specific user needs without compromising simplicity or privacy.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A local-first iOS running tracker that captures essential metrics (GPS route, time, distance, pace) and stores everything locally on the device. No accounts, no internet dependency for core functionality, no social features.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Privacy-First:** All data stays on device, zero cloud dependency
- **Extreme Simplicity:** Only essential features, minimal UI complexity
- **Local Performance:** Fast app performance with immediate data access
- **Personal Focus:** Built for individual improvement, not social comparison

**Success Vision:** A runner opens the app, taps "Start", goes for a run, taps "Finish", views their route and stats, and sees their running history - all within 3 taps and zero setup.

## Target Users
