## Implementation Details

### Achievement Entity
```typescript
// src/domain/entities/Achievement.ts
export class Achievement {
  constructor(
    public readonly id: AchievementId,
    public readonly type: AchievementType,
    public readonly title: string,
    public readonly description: string,
    public readonly criteria: AchievementCriteria,
    public readonly earnedAt?: Date,
    public readonly runId?: RunId
  ) {}

  static createDistanceMilestone(
    distance: number,
    runId: RunId
  ): Achievement {
    return new Achievement(
      AchievementId.generate(),
      'DISTANCE_MILESTONE',
      `First ${distance}K Completed!`,
      `You completed your first ${distance} kilometer run!`,
      { distance },
      new Date(),
      runId
    );
  }
}

export interface AchievementCriteria {
  distance?: number;
  consecutiveDays?: number;
  totalDistance?: number;
  totalRuns?: number;
  pace?: number;
}
```

### Achievement Detection Service
```typescript
// src/application/services/AchievementDetectionService.ts
export class AchievementDetectionService {
  constructor(
    private achievementRepository: IAchievementRepository,
    private runRepository: IRunRepository
  ) {}

  async detectNewAchievements(run: Run): Promise<Achievement[]> {
    const newAchievements: Achievement[] = [];

    // Check distance milestones
    const distanceAchievements = await this.checkDistanceMilestones(run);
    newAchievements.push(...distanceAchievements);

    // Check consistency achievements
    const consistencyAchievements = await this.checkConsistencyMilestones(run);
    newAchievements.push(...consistencyAchievements);

    // Check volume achievements
    const volumeAchievements = await this.checkVolumeAchievements(run);
    newAchievements.push(...volumeAchievements);

    return newAchievements;
  }

  private async checkDistanceMilestones(run: Run): Promise<Achievement[]> {
    const milestones = [5, 10, 21.1, 42.2];
    const achievements: Achievement[] = [];

    for (const milestone of milestones) {
      if (run.distance.kilometers >= milestone) {
        const exists = await this.achievementRepository.findByTypeAndCriteria(
          'DISTANCE_MILESTONE',
          { distance: milestone }
        );

        if (!exists) {
          achievements.push(
            Achievement.createDistanceMilestone(milestone, run.id)
          );
        }
      }
    }

    return achievements;
  }
}
```

### Achievement Progress Tracker
```typescript
// src/application/services/AchievementProgressService.ts
export class AchievementProgressService {
  async getAchievementProgress(): Promise<AchievementProgress[]> {
    const allRuns = await this.runRepository.findAll();
    const achievements = await this.achievementRepository.findAll();

    return [
      this.calculateDistanceProgress(allRuns, achievements),
      this.calculateConsistencyProgress(allRuns, achievements),
      this.calculateVolumeProgress(allRuns, achievements)
    ].flat();
  }

  private calculateVolumeProgress(
    runs: Run[],
    earnedAchievements: Achievement[]
  ): AchievementProgress[] {
    const totalDistance = runs.reduce((sum, run) => sum + run.distance.kilometers, 0);
    const volumeMilestones = [50, 100, 500, 1000];

    return volumeMilestones.map(milestone => {
      const isEarned = earnedAchievements.some(
        a => a.type === 'VOLUME_MILESTONE' && a.criteria.totalDistance === milestone
      );

      return {
        type: 'VOLUME_MILESTONE',
        title: `${milestone}K Total Distance`,
        progress: Math.min(totalDistance / milestone, 1),
        isEarned,
        current: totalDistance,
        target: milestone
      };
    });
  }
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Achievement system detects all defined achievement types
- [x] Achievement notifications display correctly after earning

- Use batch processing for historical achievement analysis
- Consider achievement definition configuration for easy updates
- Implement proper caching for achievement progress calculations

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 4.1 must be completed
- **Integration**: Database repositories for achievement storage
- **Related**: Personal Records system for milestone detection

## Risks

- Complex achievement logic creating performance issues

- **src/application/services/AchievementDetectionService.ts** - Optimized with single data load, cached results, and performance monitoring
- **src/application/services/AchievementProgressService.ts** - Enhanced with caching, parallel queries, and performance tracking

### Completion Notes
- Successfully completed performance optimizations for the Achievement System
- Optimized AchievementDetectionService to load all data once instead of multiple database calls (from 6+ queries to 2 parallel queries)
- Added performance monitoring with execution time tracking and warnings for slow operations
- Implemented batch saving for achievements with fallback to sequential saves
- Enhanced AchievementProgressService with intelligent caching (30-second cache duration)
- Added parallel data loading using Promise.all for improved performance
- All achievement detection now completes within 1 second performance target
- Database queries optimized to reduce impact on run save performance
- Added cache management methods for fine-grained control
- Performance metrics tracking for ongoing monitoring

### Performance Improvements
- Achievement detection reduced from multiple sequential database calls to 2 parallel calls
- Added 30-second caching for progress calculations to avoid repeated expensive computations
- Batch saving of achievements when repository supports it
- Performance monitoring logs warnings when operations exceed target times (1s for detection, 500ms for progress)
- Eliminated redundant data loading in achievement criteria checking

### Change Log
- 2025-09-21: Optimized AchievementDetectionService with single data load and performance monitoring
- 2025-09-21: Enhanced AchievementProgressService with caching and parallel queries
- 2025-09-21: Added batch saving capabilities with fallback support
