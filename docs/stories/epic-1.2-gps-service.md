# Story 1.2: GPS Location Service Implementation

**Epic**: Foundation & GPS Core Infrastructure
**Story ID**: 1.2
**Priority**: Must Have
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

## User Story

As a developer,
I want to implement GPS location tracking using Expo Location API,
so that the app can capture user location during runs.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. GPS Service Interface Definition
- [ ] IGPSService interface created with methods: startTracking(), stopTracking(), getCurrentLocation()
- [ ] GPSPoint value object defined with latitude, longitude, timestamp, accuracy
- [ ] Result Pattern implemented for error handling (no exceptions)
- [ ] GPS error types defined: PERMISSION_DENIED, GPS_DISABLED, SIGNAL_LOST, TIMEOUT

### 2. Permission Management
- [ ] Location permissions requested using expo-location requestForegroundPermissionsAsync
- [ ] Permission denial handled gracefully with user-friendly messaging
- [ ] Permission request retry mechanism implemented
- [ ] Background location permission handled for continuous tracking

### 3. GPS Tracking Implementation
- [ ] ExpoGPSService class implements IGPSService interface
- [ ] GPS tracking starts with Location.Accuracy.BestForNavigation
- [ ] Location updates captured at 1-second intervals
- [ ] GPS points stored in memory during active tracking session
- [ ] Tracking can be started, paused, and stopped without data loss

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] GPS signal loss detected and handled gracefully
- [ ] GPS disabled scenario handled with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Timeout handling for GPS acquisition (10 seconds max)
- [ ] Poor accuracy warnings when GPS accuracy > 10 meters
- [ ] Network-independent operation (no internet required)

### 5. Performance Requirements
- [ ] GPS service starts within 10 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for long tracking sessions (1+ hours)
- [ ] Battery usage minimized while maintaining accuracy requirements
- [ ] GPS service can handle 3600+ location updates per hour

### 6. Service Architecture
- [ ] Service follows Clean Architecture patterns
- [ ] Dependency injection ready for testing and mocking
- [ ] Service lifecycle managed properly (start/stop/pause)
- [ ] Thread-safe operations for background processing

### 7. Data Quality Validation
- [ ] GPS accuracy validation (reject points with accuracy > 50 meters)
- [ ] Speed validation (reject points indicating impossible speeds > 50 km/h)
- [ ] Temporal validation (ensure reasonable time intervals between points)
- [ ] Duplicate point filtering to prevent data pollution

### 8. Testing Implementation
- [ ] Unit tests with mocked expo-location
- [ ] GPS service behavior tested for all error scenarios
- [ ] Permission handling tested with different permission states
- [ ] Performance testing for memory and battery usage
- [ ] Integration testing with real GPS hardware

## Implementation Details

### GPS Service Structure
```typescript
// src/infrastructure/gps/ExpoGPSService.ts
export class ExpoGPSService implements IGPSService {
  private subscription: Location.LocationSubscription | null = null;
  private trackingPoints: GPSPoint[] = [];

  async startTracking(): Promise<Result<void, GPSError>> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async stopTracking(): Promise<Result<GPSPoint[], GPSError>> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async getCurrentLocation(): Promise<Result<GPSPoint, GPSError>> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Configuration Settings
- **Accuracy**: Location.Accuracy.BestForNavigation
- **Time Interval**: 1000ms (1 second)
- **Distance Interval**: 5 meters minimum movement
- **Timeout**: 10000ms for initial GPS acquisition

## Definition of Done

- [ ] GPS service can successfully track location with required accuracy
- [ ] All permission scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Service integrates with dependency injection container
- [ ] Unit tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Real device testing validates GPS accuracy within 10 meters
- [ ] Battery usage meets performance requirements (< 25% per hour)
- [ ] Service handles interruptions and recovery scenarios

## Technical Notes

- Use expo-location watchPositionAsync for continuous tracking
- Implement proper cleanup in stopTracking to prevent memory leaks
- Consider implementing GPS point smoothing for better route quality
- Handle iOS background location restrictions properly

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Story 1.1 (Project Setup) must be completed
- **External**: expo-location package properly configured

## Risks

- iOS background location limitations
- GPS accuracy issues in urban environments
- Battery drain from continuous GPS usage
- Permission denial by user blocking core functionality
