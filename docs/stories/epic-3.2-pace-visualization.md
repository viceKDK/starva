## Implementation Details

### Pace Chart Component
```typescript
// src/presentation/components/PaceChartComponent.tsx
export const PaceChartComponent: React.FC<PaceChartProps> = ({
  gpsPoints,
  chartType = 'time',
  onDataPointPress
}) => {
  const paceData = useMemo(() =>
    processPaceData(gpsPoints, chartType), [gpsPoints, chartType]
  );

  return (
    <View style={styles.chartContainer}>
      <LineChart
        data={paceData}
        width={screenWidth - 32}
        height={220}
        chartConfig={chartConfig}
        onDataPointClick={onDataPointPress}
        withInnerLines={true}
        withOuterLines={true}
        withDots={false}
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Pace Data Processing Service
```typescript
// src/application/services/PaceAnalysisService.ts
export class PaceAnalysisService {
  processGPSDataForPacing(gpsPoints: GPSPoint[]): PaceAnalysis {
    const segments = this.createKilometerSegments(gpsPoints);
    const splits = segments.map(segment => this.calculateSegmentPace(segment));

    return {
      splits,
      fastestSplit: Math.min(...splits),
      slowestSplit: Math.max(...splits),
      averagePace: splits.reduce((sum, pace) => sum + pace, 0) / splits.length,
      paceConsistency: this.calculateStandardDeviation(splits)
    };
  }

  private createKilometerSegments(gpsPoints: GPSPoint[]): GPSPoint[][] {
    const segments: GPSPoint[][] = [];
    let currentSegment: GPSPoint[] = [];
    let distanceAccumulator = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < gpsPoints.length; i++) {
      const distance = this.calculateDistance(gpsPoints[i-1], gpsPoints[i]);
      distanceAccumulator += distance;
      currentSegment.push(gpsPoints[i]);

      if (distanceAccumulator >= 1000) { // 1 kilometer
        segments.push([...currentSegment]);
        currentSegment = [gpsPoints[i]];
        distanceAccumulator = 0;
      }
    }

    return segments;
  }
}
```

### Split Times Table Component
```typescript
// src/presentation/components/SplitTimesTable.tsx
export const SplitTimesTable: React.FC<{ splits: SplitData[] }> = ({ splits }) => {
  const fastestSplit = Math.min(...splits.map(s => s.pace));
  const slowestSplit = Math.max(...splits.map(s => s.pace));

  return (
    <View style={styles.tableContainer}>
      <Text style={styles.tableHeader}>Kilometer Splits</Text>
      {splits.map((split, index) => (
        <SplitRow
          key={index}
          kilometer={index + 1}
          pace={split.pace}
          time={split.time}
          isFastest={split.pace === fastestSplit}
          isSlowest={split.pace === slowestSplit}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Pace chart displays accurately for all run types
- [x] Kilometer splits calculated and displayed correctly
- [x] Interactive features work smoothly on iOS devices
- [x] Performance metrics provide meaningful insights
- [x] Chart rendering optimized for various data sizes
- [x] Error handling prevents crashes with invalid data
- [x] Visual design follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- [x] Component tests verify chart rendering and interactions

## Technical Notes

- Use react-native-chart-kit or similar for chart implementation
- Implement proper data smoothing for GPS noise
- Consider chart performance with very long runs (20+ km)
- Follow iOS accessibility guidelines for chart content

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Stories 2.1 and 2.3 for run data integration
- **External**: Chart library (react-native-chart-kit)
- **Related**: Story 3.1 for potential route-pace correlation

## Risks

- Chart library compatibility with React Native
- Performance issues with large datasets (3+ hour runs)
- Complex pace calculation accuracy with GPS variations
- User confusion with too many pace metrics displayed
