# Story 1.4: Basic Run Tracking Screen Implementation

**Epic**: Foundation & GPS Core Infrastructure
**Story ID**: 1.4
**Priority**: Must Have
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

## User Story

As a user,
I want a basic run tracking screen with start/pause/stop functionality,
so that I can control my run recording sessions with clear visual feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Screen Layout and Navigation
- [x] Run tracking screen accessible from bottom tab navigation
- [x] Screen uses React Navigation with proper TypeScript types
- [x] Screen header shows current session status (Ready, Tracking, Paused)
- [x] Back navigation disabled during active tracking sessions

### 2. Control Button Implementation
- [x] Large circular "Start" button prominently displayed when ready
- [x] "Pause" and "Stop" buttons appear during active tracking
- [x] Button states visually distinct with appropriate colors (green/yellow/red)
- [x] Buttons disabled during GPS initialization with loading indicators
- [x] Touch feedback and haptic response on button interactions

### 3. Real-Time Metrics Display
- [x] Current run duration displayed in HH:MM:SS format
- [x] Current distance shown in kilometers with 2 decimal precision
- [x] Current pace displayed in MM:SS per kilometer format
- [x] Metrics update every second during active tracking
- [x] Metrics formatted consistently with app design standards

### 4. GPS Status Indicators
- [x] GPS signal strength indicator (weak/good/excellent)
- [x] GPS accuracy status displayed (Â±X meters)
- [x] Loading state shown during GPS initialization
- [x] Warning displayed when GPS accuracy exceeds 15 meters
- [x] Error messages for GPS permission denial or service disabled

### 5. Run Session State Management
- [x] Session state persists through screen navigation
- [x] Session state maintained during app backgrounding (iOS restrictions apply)
- [x] State cleared only after successful run save or explicit cancellation
- [x] Session data survives app crashes with recovery mechanism

### 6. User Experience Enhancements
- [x] Screen stays on during active tracking sessions
- [x] Swipe gestures disabled to prevent accidental navigation
- [x] Visual confirmation dialogs for pause/stop actions
- [x] Progress indicators during GPS acquisition (max 10 seconds)
- [x] Accessibility labels for all interactive elements

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery
- [x] Graceful handling of GPS permission changes during session
- [x] Recovery from GPS signal loss with user notifications
- [x] Handling of device rotation and screen changes
- [x] Battery low warnings with tracking continuation options
- [x] Network independence (no internet required)

### 8. Performance Requirements
- [x] Screen renders within 2 seconds of navigation
- [x] UI updates smoothly at 60fps during metric updates
- [x] Memory usage optimized for extended tracking sessions
- [x] Battery usage minimized while maintaining functionality

## Implementation Details

### Screen Structure
```typescript
// src/presentation/screens/RunTrackingScreen.tsx
export const RunTrackingScreen: React.FC = () => {
  const controller = useRunTrackingController();

  return (
    <RunTrackingScreenView
      sessionState={controller.sessionState}
      metrics={controller.currentMetrics}
      gpsStatus={controller.gpsStatus}
      onStart={controller.startTracking}
      onPause={controller.pauseTracking}
      onStop={controller.stopTracking}
    />
  );
};
```

### Controller Integration
```typescript
// src/presentation/controllers/RunTrackingController.ts
export const useRunTrackingController = () => {
  const startTrackingUseCase = useStartTrackingUseCase();
  const pauseTrackingUseCase = usePauseTrackingUseCase();

  const startTracking = async () => {
    const result = await startTrackingUseCase.execute();
    // Handle result with proper error states
  };
};
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Screen successfully integrates with navigation system
- [x] All control buttons function correctly with proper state management
- [x] Real-time metrics display accurately during tracking sessions
- [x] GPS status indicators provide clear user feedback
- [x] Error scenarios handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [x] Screen performance meets requirements during extended sessions
- [x] Component tests verify all user interactions
- [x] Integration tests validate controller connections

## Technical Notes

- Use React Native's keepAwake API during active sessions
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for control button sizing
- Use consistent typography and spacing from design system

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 must be completed
- **Integration**: Story 1.5 (Run Session State Management) for state handling
- **Related**: UseCase implementations for tracking operations

## Risks

- iOS background limitations affecting session continuity
- Battery drain from screen-on requirements during long runs
- Complex state management across navigation and app lifecycle
- User confusion with button state changes during GPS acquisition
