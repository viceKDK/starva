## Implementation Details

### Personal Record Entity
```typescript
// src/domain/entities/PersonalRecord.ts
export class PersonalRecord {
  constructor(
    public readonly id: PersonalRecordId,
    public readonly category: RecordCategory,
    public readonly value: number,
    public readonly runId: RunId,
    public readonly achievedAt: Date,
    public readonly previousValue?: number
  ) {}

  static create(
    category: RecordCategory,
    value: number,
    runId: RunId,
    previousValue?: number
  ): PersonalRecord {
    return new PersonalRecord(
      PersonalRecordId.generate(),
      category,
      value,
      runId,
      new Date(),
      previousValue
    );
  }
}

export type RecordCategory =
  | 'LONGEST_DISTANCE'
  | 'FASTEST_5K'
  | 'FASTEST_10K'
  | 'FASTEST_HALF_MARATHON'
  | 'BEST_PACE_1K'
  | 'BEST_PACE_5K'
  | 'LONGEST_DURATION';
```

### PR Detection Service
```typescript
// src/application/services/PersonalRecordDetectionService.ts
export class PersonalRecordDetectionService {
  constructor(
    private recordRepository: IPersonalRecordRepository,
    private runRepository: IRunRepository
  ) {}

  async detectNewRecords(run: Run): Promise<PersonalRecord[]> {
    const newRecords: PersonalRecord[] = [];
    const categories = this.getApplicableCategories(run);

    for (const category of categories) {
      const currentRecord = await this.recordRepository.findByCategory(category);
      const newValue = this.extractValueForCategory(run, category);

      if (this.isNewRecord(newValue, currentRecord)) {
        const record = PersonalRecord.create(
          category,
          newValue,
          run.id,
          currentRecord?.value
        );
        newRecords.push(record);
      }
    }

    return newRecords;
  }

  private getApplicableCategories(run: Run): RecordCategory[] {
    const categories: RecordCategory[] = ['LONGEST_DISTANCE', 'LONGEST_DURATION'];

    // Add pace categories based on run distance
    if (run.distance.kilometers >= 1) categories.push('BEST_PACE_1K');
    if (run.distance.kilometers >= 5) categories.push('FASTEST_5K', 'BEST_PACE_5K');
    if (run.distance.kilometers >= 10) categories.push('FASTEST_10K');
    if (run.distance.kilometers >= 21.1) categories.push('FASTEST_HALF_MARATHON');

    return categories;
  }
}
```

### Personal Records Screen
```typescript
// src/presentation/screens/PersonalRecordsScreen.tsx
export const PersonalRecordsScreen: React.FC = () => {
  const controller = usePersonalRecordsController();

  return (
    <PersonalRecordsView
      records={controller.records}
      isLoading={controller.isLoading}
      onRecordTap={controller.navigateToRecord}
      onRefresh={controller.refreshRecords}
    />
  );
};
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Personal records detected automatically for all applicable categories
- [x] New record notifications display immediately after achievement
- [x] Personal records dashboard shows all current records accurately
- [x] Record validation prevents false positives
- [x] Historical record analysis works for existing users
- [x] Performance meets requirements during record detection
- [x] Database integrity maintained for all record operations
- [x] Component tests verify record detection logic

## Technical Notes

- Store personal records in separate table for query optimization
- Use database triggers or application logic for record detection
- Consider caching current records for performance
- Implement proper transaction handling for record updates

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Stories 2.1 (Run Completion) and 2.2 (Run History) completed
- **Integration**: Database repository for record storage
- **Related**: Story 4.2 (Achievement System) for celebration features

## Risks

- Complex record detection logic creating edge case bugs
- Performance impact on run save process
- Data integrity issues with concurrent record updates
- User confusion about what constitutes a valid personal record
