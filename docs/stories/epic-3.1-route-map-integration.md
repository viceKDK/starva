**Epic**: Route Visualization & Maps
**Story ID**: 3.1
**Priority**: Should Have
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours

## User Story

As a user,
I want to see my running routes displayed on interactive maps with GPS tracking visualization,
so that I can visualize where I ran and analyze my route choices.

- [x] Route smoothing for GPS noise reduction
- [x] Gaps in GPS data handled gracefully
- [x] Invalid GPS points filtered out

### 8. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [x] No GPS data scenarios handled with appropriate message
- [x] Map service failures handled gracefully
- [x] Very short routes (under 100m) displayed properly
- [x] Routes with significant gaps shown correctly
- [x] Corrupt GPS data filtered and user notified

## Implementation Details

### Map Component Structure
```typescript
// src/presentation/components/RouteMapComponent.tsx
export const RouteMapComponent: React.FC<RouteMapProps> = ({
  gpsPoints,
  onRoutePress,
  mapType = 'standard'
}) => {
  const mapRegion = useMemo(() => calculateOptimalRegion(gpsPoints), [gpsPoints]);
  const simplifiedRoute = useMemo(() => simplifyRoute(gpsPoints), [gpsPoints]);

  return (
    <MapView
      style={styles.map}
      region={mapRegion}
      mapType={mapType}
      showsUserLocation={false}
      showsMyLocationButton={false}
    >
      <RoutePolyline
        coordinates={simplifiedRoute}
        onPress={onRoutePress}
      />
      <RouteMarkers
        start={gpsPoints[0]}
        finish={gpsPoints[gpsPoints.length - 1]}
      />
    </MapView>
  );
};
```

### Route Simplification Service
```typescript
// src/infrastructure/maps/RouteSimplificationService.ts
export class RouteSimplificationService {
  simplifyRoute(points: GPSPoint[], tolerance: number = 0.0001): GPSPoint[] {
    if (points.length <= 100) return points;

    // Douglas-Peucker algorithm for route simplification
    return this.douglasPeucker(points, tolerance);
  }

  private douglasPeucker(points: GPSPoint[], tolerance: number): GPSPoint[] {
    // Implementation of line simplification algorithm
  }
}
```

### Map Region Calculation
```typescript
// src/presentation/utils/MapRegionCalculator.ts
export class MapRegionCalculator {
  static calculateOptimalRegion(gpsPoints: GPSPoint[]): Region {
    if (gpsPoints.length === 0) return DEFAULT_REGION;

    const latitudes = gpsPoints.map(p => p.latitude);
    const longitudes = gpsPoints.map(p => p.longitude);

    const minLat = Math.min(...latitudes);
    const maxLat = Math.max(...latitudes);
    const minLng = Math.min(...longitudes);
    const maxLng = Math.max(...longitudes);

    const padding = 0.001; // Comfortable padding around route

    return {
      latitude: (minLat + maxLat) / 2,
      longitude: (minLng + maxLng) / 2,
      latitudeDelta: (maxLat - minLat) + padding,
      longitudeDelta: (maxLng - minLng) + padding
    };
  }
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Maps display correctly on iOS devices
- [x] GPS routes render accurately with proper visualization
- [x] Map performance acceptable for large routes (1000+ GPS points)
- [x] Interactive features work smoothly (zoom, pan, tap)
- [x] Route analysis visual enhancements implemented
- [x] Error scenarios handled with user-friendly feedback
- [x] Memory usage optimized for extended map usage
- [x] Component tests verify map rendering and interactions

## Technical Notes

- Configure react-native-maps with proper iOS permissions
- Use route simplification for performance with large datasets
- Implement proper map tile caching strategy
- Consider MapKit (iOS) native integration for better performance

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Story 2.3 (Run Details View) for integration
- **External**: react-native-maps library properly configured
- **Platform**: iOS location and maps permissions

## Risks

- react-native-maps configuration complexity
- Performance issues with very large GPS datasets
- Memory usage from map tiles and route rendering
- iOS maps service limitations or restrictions
- GPS data quality affecting route visualization accuracy
